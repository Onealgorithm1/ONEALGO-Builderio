## **🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Automatic Push-to-Deploy (GitHub Actions + Netlify)**

1. In your GitHub repository settings, add two secrets: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (you can grab both from the Netlify dashboard for the site you want to publish).
2. Ensure the branch that should auto-deploy (currently `main`) allows direct pushes or fast-forwards. If branch protections enforce reviews, merge PRs into `main`—the workflow still runs immediately after the merge commit lands.
3. The workflow lives at `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml`. It checks out the code, installs dependencies with pnpm, runs `pnpm build`, and then executes `pnpm deploy:netlify`, which calls `netlify deploy --dir=dist/spa --functions=netlify/functions --prod`.
4. Push changes straight to `main` (e.g., with the Builder UI **Push/Create/PR** button configured for direct pushes). As soon as the commit hits GitHub, the "Deploy to Netlify on push" workflow will build and publish the site live without waiting for a PR approval.
5. Need to halt a bad deploy? Revert the commit (or use Netlify’s "Rollback deploy" button) and push again—the workflow will redeploy the previous good state.

> Prefer to manage hosting without GitHub Actions? You can still [Connect Netlify](#open-mcp-popover) or [Connect Vercel](#open-mcp-popover) via MCP and trigger deploys directly from Builder.

### **Manual Git Push (Fallback)**

If you ever need to bypass the automation (for instance, while rotating secrets), you can still push manually:

```bash
git push origin ai_main_c12c8e76f0c4:main
```
